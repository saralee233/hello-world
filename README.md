Hi! I'm Sara Dorris.

For the past 5 years, I've thrived as a Business Systems Analyst, but my passion for technology is calling me in a new direction. My graduate degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems ignited a spark, equipping me with C# programming, database design, and data modeling skills.

While my current role hasn't been heavily technical, I possess a strong foundation and the communication skills to bridge the gap.  Being a Certified Scrum Master has further honed my ability to collaborate effectively.

I'm eager to leverage my business acumen and user-centric approach to excel in a technical role. My experience translating complex ideas for non-technical audiences will be a valuable asset as I embark on this exciting new chapter.

This is my LinkedIn please add me. I'd love to connect and talk tech: https://www.linkedin.com/in/saradorris/
